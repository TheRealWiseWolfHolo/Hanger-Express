# Hangar Express

SwiftUI iOS app for retrieving, organizing, and acting on a Star Citizen hangar.

## Current Capabilities

- Browser-backed RSI sign-in with saved sessions, local snapshot restore, and developer preview support for Xcode previews.
- Live sync for hangar pledges, fleet ships, buy-back entries, hangar logs, and account details into app-owned models.
- Hosted ship catalog and ship-detail enrichment from `https://starcitizen-info.pages.dev/`, with GitHub Pages as fallback.
- Fleet detail screens enriched with hosted ship specs such as crew, size, components, weapons, and utility entries.
- Fleet card long-press to jump from a ship to the pledges that contain it, reusing the hangar pledge detail flow.
- Melt, gift, and apply-upgrade flows, protected by local device-owner authentication before the RSI action is sent.
- Persistent local image caching for remote ship art and generated upgrade composite thumbnails, with Settings cache clear support.

## Runtime Notes

The shipped app boots with `AppEnvironment.live`. The preview environment still exists for Xcode previews and demo flows, but the main runtime path is live:

1. Sign in through a browser-backed session flow.
2. Capture and reuse authenticated RSI cookies for refreshes and other read operations.
3. Sync hangar pages, fleet projections, buy-back pages, logs, account metadata, and hosted ship detail data into normalized local models.
4. Use the hosted ship feeds from `starcitizen-info.pages.dev` by default, with GitHub Pages as backup, to enrich fleet and ship-detail UI.
5. For sensitive pledge actions like melt, gift, and apply upgrade, require both local device-owner authentication and the current RSI password because RSI still gates those actions with password-confirmed requests.

More detail is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
